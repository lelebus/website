Gabriele is a Web Designer, Web & Software Engineer and is part of the {{<link "flashbeing.com">}}FlashBeing{{</>}} team. He lives in the Dolomites of South Tyrol, interacting daily with Italian, German and English languages.

Before he started working and freelancing in the Software Industrie, he experimented with completely different occupations: cooking and bartending. Beer has become one of his hobbies, together with sport, music and magic, and in 2018 he earned the Beer Expert certificate. Thanks to the passion transmitted by the father, he has also a vast knowledge of wine. This enabled him to develop his first Software: a Wine Cellar Management System.

He works now as a full-time developer, while completing the studies in Computer Science at the Free University of Bolzano.
